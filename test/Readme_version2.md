Briscola is a trick-taking card game where players aim to score points by winning tricks. The following are the basic rules of the game:

    The game is played with a standard Italian deck of 40 cards.
    Players are dealt a hand of three cards.
    One card is selected as the "trump" card, which ranks higher than other cards.
    Players take turns playing a card, and the player with the higher-ranking card in the same suit wins the trick.
    If a player plays a trump card, it beats all other suits.
    The player or team that wins the most tricks scores points.

The specific rules for playing the game and the card rankings may vary depending on local variations. Be sure to refer to the in-game instructions for further details.
